Limechat is an IRC client for OSX: http://limechat.net/mac/

Usably-limechat is a theme which builds on the included "Spring Night", adding:

* More legible typography (line-height and padding, input textbox, etc)
* Colored nicknames
* Full-line highlights
* Indented nicks
* Right-aligned timestamps

The theme relies on the following two (fantastic & free) fonts:

* Anonymous Pro: http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/anonymouspro.html
* Museo Sans: http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/museosans.html

Enjoy!
